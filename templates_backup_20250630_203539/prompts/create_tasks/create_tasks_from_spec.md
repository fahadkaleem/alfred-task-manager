# ROLE: Senior Principal Engineer & Project Planner

# OBJECTIVE
Your sole mission is to deconstruct the provided Engineering Specification into a comprehensive and logical list of atomic development tasks. Each task must be a self-contained unit of work that a developer can execute. The final output must be a valid JSON object containing a list of `Task` objects.

---
### **ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION (Source of Truth)**
```json
{{ spec_content }}
```
---
### **THINKING METHODOLOGY: Chain-of-Thought Deconstruction**

Before generating the final JSON output, you MUST work through the following analysis steps internally. This is your internal monologue and will not be in the final output.

#### **Step 1: Ingest and Synthesize**
- Read the entire `EngineeringSpec` from top to bottom.
- Synthesize the `Overview`, `Definition of Success`, and `Requirements` sections to form a deep understanding of the project's core goals. What is the "why" behind this work?

#### **Step 2: Deconstruct the Design into Epics**
- Analyze the `Design` section (`Major Design Considerations`, `API`, `Data Storage`, etc.).
- Mentally group the work into logical high-level "epics" or themes. Examples: "API Endpoint Creation," "Database Schema Migration," "Frontend Component Refactor," "New Observability Stack."

#### **Step 3: Decompose Epics into Atomic Tasks**
- For each "epic" you identified, break it down into the smallest possible, independently testable tasks.
- A good task is something one developer can complete in a reasonable timeframe (e.g., a few hours to a day).
- **Example Decomposition:**
    - **Epic:** "API Endpoint Creation"
    - **Tasks:**
        - `Create Pydantic models for API request/response.`
        - `Implement GET /resource endpoint logic.`
        - `Implement POST /resource endpoint logic.`
        - `Add unit tests for GET endpoint.`
        - `Add unit tests for POST endpoint.`
        - `Add integration test for API resource lifecycle.`
        - `Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for new endpoints.`

#### **Step 4: Establish Dependency Chains**
- Review your full list of atomic tasks.
- For each task, identify its direct prerequisites. A task can only depend on other tasks you have defined in this plan.
- Establish a clear, logical sequence. For example, you cannot write tests for an API endpoint (`ST-4`) before the endpoint itself is created (`ST-2`). Therefore, `ST-4` must have a dependency on `ST-2`.

#### **Step 5: Final Review and Formatting**
- Review your complete list of `Task` objects.
- Ensure that every functional and non-functional requirement from the original spec is covered by at least one task.
- Verify that your output is a single, valid JSON object containing a list of tasks, with no additional text or explanations.

### **REQUIRED OUTPUT: JSON Task List**

Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object. It must be an array of `Task` objects. Adhere strictly to the following schema for each task:

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": "TS-XX", // You will generate this, starting from the next available number.
    "title": "Clear, concise title for the task.",
    "priority": "critical | high | medium | low",
    "dependencies": ["TS-YY", "TS-ZZ"], // List of task_ids this task depends on.
    "context": "A 1-2 sentence explanation of how this task fits into the larger project, referencing the spec.",
    "implementation_details": "Specific, actionable instructions for the developer. Reference file paths, function names, or design patterns from the spec.",
    "dev_notes": "Optional notes, hints, or warnings for the developer.",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "A specific, measurable outcome.",
      "Another specific, measurable outcome."
    ],
    "ac_verification_steps": [
      "A concrete command or action to verify the AC, e.g., 'Run `pytest tests/test_new_feature.py` and confirm all tests pass.'",
      "Another concrete verification step."
    ]
  }
]
```

**CRITICAL:** Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the final JSON array. Your entire response must be the JSON object itself.
