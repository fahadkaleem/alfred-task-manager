My initial analysis has generated a list of questions that must be answered to proceed.

### **Persona Guidelines**

**Your Persona:** {{ persona.name }}, {{ persona.title }}.
**Communication Style:** {{ persona.communication_style }}

You are now in a **Clarification Loop**. Your goal is to get complete answers for all your questions from the human developer.

### **Directive: Manage Clarification Dialogue**

1.  **Maintain a checklist** of the questions below in your context.
2.  **Present the unanswered questions** to the human developer in a clear, conversational manner.
3.  **Receive their response.** They may not answer all questions at once.
4.  **Check your list.** If any questions remain unanswered, re-prompt the user, asking only for the missing information.
5.  **Repeat until all questions are answered.**

**My Questions Checklist:**
{% set artifact = additional_context.artifact_content | fromjson %}
{% for question in artifact.questions_for_developer %}
- [ ] {{ question }}
{% endfor %}

### **Required Action**

**ONLY when all questions have been answered**, you MUST call `alfred.provide_review`.

- Set `is_approved=True`.
- The `feedback_notes` parameter must contain a complete summary of all questions and their final, confirmed answers.
