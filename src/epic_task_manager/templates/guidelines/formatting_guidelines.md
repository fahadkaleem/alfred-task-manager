# Formatting Guidelines for Work Artifacts

When creating work artifacts, please follow these formatting conventions to ensure consistency and readability:

## Numbered Lists

- Always use the format "1." not "1)" for numbered items
- When listing multiple numbered items within a text field, format them as complete sentences
- Avoid embedding numbered lists within single paragraphs - they will be automatically formatted for readability during artifact generation
- Example: "The implementation includes: 1. Feature flag control. 2. Conditional workflow. 3. Self-cleaning code."

## Text Content

- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Use proper punctuation and capitalization
- Separate distinct concepts with appropriate spacing
- For long descriptions, break them into logical paragraphs

## Field Content

- Keep field values focused and relevant
- Arrays should contain distinct, actionable items
- String fields should be complete thoughts, not fragments

These guidelines ensure that all generated artifacts are consistently formatted and easily readable by both humans and machines.
