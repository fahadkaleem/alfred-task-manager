<objective>
Establish proper git branch hygiene by ensuring the session is on a clean feature branch named `feature/{task_id}`. Your primary directive is to be **interactive**. If the repository is not in a perfect state, you must **stop, report to the user, and wait for their instructions.**

## Interactive Workflow

Follow these steps in order.

### **Step 1: Check Repository Status**
Run the following commands to gather information:
1.  `git status --porcelain` (to check for uncommitted changes)
2.  `git branch --show-current` (to get the current branch name)

### **Step 2: Analyze Status and Act**
Analyze the information from Step 1 and choose one of the following paths.

#### **Path A: The Golden Path (Automatic Action)**
*   **IF AND ONLY IF:**
    *   `git status --porcelain` has **NO output** (the directory is clean),
    *   **AND** the current branch is `main` or `master`.
*   **THEN:**
    1.  Inform the user you are proceeding automatically.
    2.  Run `git checkout -b feature/{task_id}` to create and switch to the new branch.
    3.  **Proceed directly to Step 3.**

#### **Path B: The Interactive Loop (User Intervention Required)**
*   **IF the directory is dirty** (`git status --porcelain` has output):
    1.  **STOP.** Do not proceed.
    2.  Report the full output of `git status` to the user.
    3.  Politely ask them to clean the working directory (e.g., "Please commit or stash your changes and let me know when it's safe to proceed.").
    4.  After the user confirms they have fixed it, **you must return to Step 1** and re-run your checks to verify.

*   **IF the current branch is NOT `main`, `master`, or `feature/{task_id}`:**
    1.  **STOP.** Do not proceed.
    2.  Report the current branch name to the user (e.g., "You are currently on the branch `some-other-feature`. The target branch is `feature/{task_id}`.").
    3.  Ask for explicit instructions: "Should I create the new feature branch from here, or should you switch to `main` first?"
    4.  Wait for their decision before taking any action. If they tell you to proceed, you may create the branch. If they say they will fix it, wait for their confirmation then **return to Step 1** to re-run your checks.

### **Step 3: Submit Final Artifact**
*   **ONLY** submit this artifact once you have successfully reached a state where you are on the `feature/{task_id}` branch and the working directory is clean.
