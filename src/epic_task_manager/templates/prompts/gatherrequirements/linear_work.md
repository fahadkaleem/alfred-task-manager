<objective>Gather and analyze requirements from a Linear task by fetching task details using Linear MCP tools and extracting key information needed for implementation planning.</objective>

<context name="Task Information">
Please gather requirements for task **{task_id}** and extract the essential information.
</context>

<instructions>
## Required Actions

1. **Fetch Linear Task Details**: Use the `mcp_linear_get_issue` tool to retrieve the complete task information from Linear.

2. **Extract Key Information**: From the Linear response, extract:
   - **Title**: The exact title from Linear
   - **Description**: The complete description including any user stories, background context, and technical details
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: All acceptance criteria listed in the task (these define what constitutes completion)

3. **Structure the Information**: Organize the extracted information into a clear, well-formatted work artifact.

## Tools Available

- `mcp_linear_get_issue`: Retrieve issue details by ID
- Other Linear MCP tools as needed

## Guidelines

- Be thorough in extracting ALL relevant information from the Linear task
- Preserve the original formatting and structure of descriptions
- Ensure acceptance criteria are complete and actionable
- If any information is missing or unclear, note this in your artifact

---

Once you have gathered all the task information, call the `submit_for_review` tool with your complete work artifact containing the task_summary, task_description, and acceptance_criteria.
</instructions>
