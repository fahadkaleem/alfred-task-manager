</role>

<objective>Gather and analyze requirements from a local task file by reading task details from a markdown file in the tasks inbox directory and extracting key information needed for implementation planning.</objective>

<context name="Task Information">
Please gather requirements for task **{task_id}** from the local tasks directory and extract the essential information.
</context>

<instructions>
## Required Actions

1. **Read Task File**: Use file reading tools to access the task file at `.epictaskmanager/tasks/{task_id}.md` (or handle the case where the task_id already includes the .md extension).

2. **Parse Markdown Content**: Extract information from the markdown file structure:
   - **Title**: From the main heading (# Title) or filename
   - **Description**: Content under "## Description" section
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Items listed under "## Acceptance Criteria" section

3. **Structure the Information**: Organize the extracted information into a clear, well-formatted work artifact.

## File Reading Guidelines

- Use the `Read` tool or similar file reading capabilities to access the task file
- Handle both `{task_id}` and `{task_id}.md` filename formats
- If the file doesn't exist, provide a clear error message
- Parse markdown structure carefully to extract the right content sections

## Expected Markdown Structure

```markdown
# Task Title

## Description
Detailed description of what needs to be done.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Additional Notes
Optional additional context.
```

## Guidelines

- Be thorough in extracting ALL relevant information from the task file
- Clean up any markdown formatting artifacts (like checkbox syntax)
- Ensure acceptance criteria are complete and actionable
- If any sections are missing, note this in your artifact

---

Once you have gathered all the task information from the local file, call the `submit_for_review` tool with your complete work artifact containing the task_summary, task_description, and acceptance_criteria.
</instructions>

<required_artifact_structure>
Your work artifact MUST contain these exact keys:
- `task_summary`: String - the task title
- `task_description`: String - the complete task description
- `acceptance_criteria`: Array of strings - each acceptance criteria as a separate array item
