<objective>Gather and structure the requirements for `{task_id}` from the provided task information.</objective>

<context name="Source Information">
{jira_ticket_info}
</context>

<instructions>
1. Extract the key information from the task
2. Structure the requirements clearly for the development team
3. If revision feedback is provided, you must address it.

## Guidelines

Extract all relevant information from the task and construct the complete requirements artifact. Call the `submit_for_review` tool with the result.
</instructions>

<required_artifact_structure>
You MUST submit a work artifact containing these EXACT fields as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "task_summary": "string - The exact summary/title from the task",
  "task_description": "string - The complete description from the task",
  "acceptance_criteria": ["array of strings - Each acceptance criterion as a separate string"]
}
```

**Example:**
```json
{
  "task_summary": "[WORKFLOW] Implement 'testing' Phase",
  "task_description": "Add testing phase as quality gate after coding phase...",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Add new 'testing' parent state to state machine",
    "Update Prompter to handle testing_working state",
    "Create TestingArtifact Pydantic model"
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL NOTES:**
- Use EXACTLY these field names: `task_summary`, `task_description`, `acceptance_criteria`
- `acceptance_criteria` must be an array of strings, not a single string
- Include the complete task description, not a summary
- Extract ALL acceptance criteria from the task
