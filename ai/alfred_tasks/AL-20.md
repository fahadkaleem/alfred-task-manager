### **TASK: AL-20**

#### **Title:**
Prompt Engineering: Inject Clarified Context into Strategy Prompt

#### **Context:**
During the validation of the `Strategize` phase, we identified a minor defect. The `strategize.md` prompt template does not render the `additional_context` (containing the developer's answers from the `review_context` phase). While the AI may retain this in its short-term memory, our architecture demands that all necessary context be explicitly provided in every prompt. This task is to fix the template to ensure these crucial clarifications are always visible to the AI when it formulates the technical strategy.

#### **Implementation Details:**
1.  **Locate the `strategize.md` template file.**
2.  **Add a new Jinja2 block.** This block will conditionally render the `additional_context.feedback_notes` if they exist. It should be placed prominently after the `Task Context` section and before the `Directive`.

**Files to Modify:**

1.  **`src/alfred/templates/prompts/plan_task/strategize.md` (MODIFY):**
    ```markdown
    # ROLE: {{ persona.name }}, {{ persona.title }}
    # ...
    # STATE: strategize

    Context is verified. The human developer has provided all necessary clarifications. We will now create the high-level technical strategy for '{{ task.title }}'.

    ### **Clarifications from Developer**
    {% if additional_context.feedback_notes %}
    The following clarifications were provided and MUST be incorporated into your strategy:
    ```
    {{ additional_context.feedback_notes }}
    ```
    {% else %}
    No specific clarifications were provided. Proceed based on the original task context.
    {% endif %}

    ### **Thinking Methodology**
    ...
    ```

#### **Acceptance Criteria & AC Verification:**
*   After this change is implemented, we will re-run the `provide_review` step from our `VT-01` validation test. We will then inspect the debug log for the subsequent `strategize` prompt and **confirm** that the "Clarifications from Developer" section is present and contains the Q&A text.
