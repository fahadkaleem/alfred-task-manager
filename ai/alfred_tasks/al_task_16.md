### **Task Directive: ALFRED-16 - Synchronize Artifact Templates with Data Models**

**Objective:** To perform a full audit and correction of all artifact templates in `src/alfred/templates/artifacts/` to ensure they are perfectly synchronized with their corresponding Pydantic models in `src/alfred/models/artifacts.py`.

**Rationale:** The templates are the "view" and the Pydantic models are the "model." If they are out of sync, the system produces corrupted or empty output. This must be rectified system-wide to ensure data integrity and reliable artifact generation.

#### **Implementation Plan: File-by-File Correction**

You will replace the content of the specified artifact templates with the following corrected versions.

**1. Correct `strategy.md` Template**

**File:** `src/alfred/templates/artifacts/strategy.md`
**Action:** Replace the entire file content.

```markdown
---
task_id: {{ task_id }}
persona: {{ persona.name }}
status: strategy_reviewed
---

# Strategy: {{ task_id }}

## 1. High-Level Strategy
{{ artifact.high_level_strategy }}

## 2. Key Components
{% for component in artifact.key_components %}
- {{ component }}
{% endfor %}

## 3. Architectural Decisions
{{ artifact.architectural_decisions }}

## 4. Risk Analysis
{{ artifact.risk_analysis }}

---
*Strategy phase completed by {{ persona.name }} ({{ persona.title }})*
```
*Correction Justification: Field names `high_level_strategy` and `risk_analysis` now match the `StrategyArtifact` model. `key_components` is now correctly rendered as a list.*

**2. Correct `solution_design.md` Template**

**File:** `src/alfred/templates/artifacts/solution_design.md`
**Action:** Replace the entire file content.

```markdown
---
task_id: {{ task_id }}
persona: {{ persona.name }}
status: solution_design_reviewed
---

# Solution Design: {{ task_id }}

## 1. Approved Strategy Summary
{{ artifact.approved_strategy_summary }}

## 2. Detailed Design
{{ artifact.detailed_design }}

## 3. File Breakdown
| File Path | Action | Change Summary |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
{% for item in artifact.file_breakdown %}
| `{{ item.file_path }}` | {{ item.action }} | {{ item.change_summary }} |
{% endfor %}

## 4. Dependencies
{% if artifact.dependencies %}
{% for dependency in artifact.dependencies %}
- {{ dependency }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
None
{% endif %}

---
*Solution design phase completed by {{ persona.name }} ({{ persona.title }})*
```
*Correction Justification: The template now correctly accesses fields from the `SolutionDesignArtifact` model and renders the `file_breakdown` list as a proper markdown table.*

**3. Correct `execution_plan.md` Template**

**File:** `src/alfred/templates/artifacts/execution_plan.md`
**Action:** Replace the entire file content.

```markdown
---
task_id: {{ task_id }}
persona: {{ persona.name }}
status: execution_plan_reviewed
---

# Execution Plan: {{ task_id }}

## 1. Implementation Steps
{% for step in artifact.implementation_steps %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ step }}
{% endfor %}

## 2. File Modifications
| File Path | Action | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
{% for mod in artifact.file_modifications %}
| `{{ mod.path }}` | {{ mod.action }} | {{ mod.description }} |
{% endfor %}

## 3. Testing Strategy
{{ artifact.testing_strategy }}

## 4. Success Criteria
{% for criterion in artifact.success_criteria %}
- {{ criterion }}
{% endfor %}

---
*Execution plan completed by {{ persona.name }} ({{ persona.title }})*
```
*Correction Justification: Field names now correctly match the `ExecutionPlanArtifact` model. `file_modifications` is now rendered as a markdown table.*

**4. Correct `devops.md` Template (Finalize Artifact)**

**File:** `src/alfred/templates/artifacts/devops.md`
**Action:** Replace the entire file content.

```markdown
---
task_id: {{ task_id }}
persona: {{ persona.name }}
status: verified
---

# Task Finalization Complete: {{ task_id }}

## Git Workflow Summary

The feature has been successfully pushed and a Pull Request has been created.

### Final Receipt

- **Commit Hash:** `{{ artifact.commit_hash }}`
- **Pull Request URL:** [{{ artifact.pull_request_url }}]({{ artifact.pull_request_url }})

The Alfred workflow for this task is now complete!
```
*Correction Justification: Ensures fields correctly match the `FinalizeArtifact` model.*

### **Conclusion**

The AI's analysis was flawless. It pinpointed a data binding error that is common in systems that separate data models from views. By implementing this directive, you will close this gap, and the artifacts will now be populated with the correct data.

This incident also validates the need for **automated testing of templates**, which remains on our future roadmap. A test could have caught this schema drift before it became a runtime issue. For now, this manual correction is the required action. Execute it.
