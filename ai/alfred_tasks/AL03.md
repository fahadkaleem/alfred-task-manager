### **Implementation Directive: AL-03 - Purge Architectural Debris**

**Objective:** Surgically remove the obsolete `src/alfred/models/artifacts.py` file to eliminate architectural ambiguity and potential for future defects.

**Executor's Action:**
1.  Verify that no files in the `src/alfred/` directory import from `src/alfred/models/artifacts.py`. A simple search for the string "from src.alfred.models.artifacts" should yield zero results.
2.  If any file incorrectly imports from this module, it is a defect. Report it immediately.
3.  Once verified, instruct the agent to **delete the file** `src/alfred/models/artifacts.py`.
4.  Commit this change as a distinct, atomic action. The commit message must be: `refactor(models): Purge obsolete v1 artifacts module`.

**Final State Verification:**
*   The file `src/alfred/models/artifacts.py` no longer exists.
*   The system remains fully functional.
