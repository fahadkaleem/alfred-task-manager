# Alfred State Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive state management system for Alfred's workflow tools. The system was implemented to address a critical issue where state transitions could corrupt the workflow if any operation failed during the transition.

## Problem Statement

### The Original Issue

During testing, we discovered a critical state corruption bug:

1. The `provide_review` tool successfully transitioned state from `review_context` to `strategize`
2. But then crashed with a Jinja2 error when generating the next prompt
3. This left the system in a corrupted state where:
   - The task was in `strategize` state in memory
   - But had no active tool after the crash
   - Recovery attempts failed with "No active tool found"

### Root Causes

1. **Non-Atomic State Transitions**: State changes happened before prompt generation
2. **No State Persistence**: Tools existed only in memory
3. **No Recovery Mechanism**: No way to reconstruct tools after crashes
4. **Template Errors as Critical Path**: Prompt generation failures corrupted workflow state

## Solution Architecture

### New Components

#### 1. State Management Module (`src/alfred/state/`)

**StateManager** (`manager.py`):
- Provides atomic state persistence with temp file + rename pattern
- Manages tool state files in `.alfred/workspace/{task_id}/tool_state.json`
- Singleton instance accessible as `state_manager`

**ToolRecovery** (`recovery.py`):
- Reconstructs workflow tools from persisted state
- Maintains a registry of tool types for recovery
- Handles state string-to-enum conversions

#### 2. Extended Models (`src/alfred/models/state.py`)

**WorkflowState**:
```python
class WorkflowState(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    tool_name: str
    current_state: str
    context_store: Dict[str, Any]
    persona_name: str
    artifact_map_states: List[str]
    created_at: str
    updated_at: str
```

### Updated Components

#### 1. Atomic State Transitions

Both `provide_review.py` and `submit_work.py` now implement a two-phase commit pattern:

**Phase 1 - Prepare**:
- Validate all inputs
- Calculate next state
- Generate prompts (most likely to fail)
- Prepare all data

**Phase 2 - Commit**:
- Only if Phase 1 succeeds completely
- Transition state
- Persist to disk immediately
- Return success

**Rollback on Failure**:
- Restore original state
- Persist rolled-back state
- Return meaningful error

#### 2. Tool Recovery

`plan_task.py` now implements a three-tier recovery strategy:

1. **Check Memory**: Look for existing tool in `orchestrator.active_tools`
2. **Check Disk**: Try to recover from `tool_state.json`
3. **Create New**: Only if no existing state found

This ensures tools can resume from any state after a crash.

## Implementation Details

### State File Structure

```json
{
  "task_id": "TS-01",
  "tool_name": "plan_task",
  "current_state": "strategize",
  "context_store": {
    "contextualize_artifact": {...},
    "feedback_notes": "User clarifications..."
  },
  "persona_name": "planning",
  "artifact_map_states": ["contextualize", "strategize", "design", "generate_slots"],
  "created_at": "2025-06-29T01:30:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-06-29T01:35:00Z"
}
```

### Key Code Changes

#### provide_review.py
```python
# Before: State transition first, then prompt generation
getattr(active_tool, trigger)()  # Could leave corrupted state
next_prompt = prompter.generate_prompt(...)  # If this fails, state is corrupted

# After: Prompt generation first, then state transition
next_prompt = prompter.generate_prompt(...)  # Calculate everything first
getattr(active_tool, trigger)()  # Only transition if everything succeeded
state_manager.save_tool_state(task_id, active_tool)  # Persist immediately
```

#### plan_task.py
```python
# Recovery logic
if task_id in orchestrator.active_tools:
    # Use existing tool
elif tool_instance := ToolRecovery.recover_tool(task_id):
    # Recovered from disk
else:
    # Create new tool
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: State persists across crashes and restarts
2. **Atomicity**: No partial state transitions possible
3. **Recoverability**: Tools can resume from any state
4. **Debuggability**: Clear state files for troubleshooting
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new tool types

## Migration Notes

- Existing workflows continue to work without modification
- State files are created automatically on first use
- No database migrations required
- Backward compatible with existing task files

## Future Enhancements

1. **State History**: Keep versioned state for debugging
2. **State Compression**: Compress large context stores
3. **State Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive context data
4. **Distributed State**: Support for multi-node deployments
5. **State Analytics**: Track state transition patterns

## Testing

To test the recovery mechanism:

1. Start a planning workflow
2. Kill the process mid-workflow
3. Call `plan_task` again with the same task_id
4. Observe that it resumes from the last saved state

## Conclusion

This implementation transforms Alfred from a stateless, crash-vulnerable system to a robust, stateful workflow engine that can recover gracefully from failures. The atomic state transitions ensure data consistency, while the recovery mechanism provides resilience against crashes and restarts.
