# High-Risk Refactoring Opportunities

This document identifies refactoring opportunities that are considered high-risk due to their complexity, widespread impact, or critical nature. These should be handled carefully with comprehensive testing.

## 1. Decompose Large Functions

### `provide_review_impl` (src/alfred/tools/provide_review.py)
- **Current state**: 105 lines, handles multiple responsibilities
- **Risk**: Core function in the review workflow, affects all tool state transitions
- **Suggested decomposition**:
  - Extract terminal state handling logic (lines 97-123)
  - Extract context building for next prompt
  - Create separate handler for different tool cleanup scenarios
- **Testing required**: Integration tests for all workflow tools

### `submit_work_impl` (src/alfred/tools/submit_work.py)
- **Current state**: 54 lines, mixes validation, state transition, and context building
- **Risk**: Critical for all work submissions across the system
- **Suggested decomposition**:
  - Extract artifact validation logic
  - Separate state transition preparation from execution
  - Create dedicated context builder for transitions
- **Testing required**: Unit tests for each decomposed function, integration tests for workflow

## 2. Extract Common Workflow Tool Base Pattern

### Workflow Tool Classes (src/alfred/core/workflow.py)
- **Current state**: 6 similar classes with identical initialization patterns
- **Risk**: Changes affect all workflow tools (ImplementTaskTool, ReviewTaskTool, etc.)
- **Suggested refactoring**:
  ```python
  class SingleStateWorkflowTool(BaseWorkflowTool):
      """Base class for workflow tools with a single main work state."""
      def __init__(self, task_id: str, tool_name: str, 
                   work_state: Enum, artifact_class: Type[BaseModel]):
          # Common initialization pattern
  ```
- **Testing required**: Ensure all existing workflow tools maintain identical behavior

## 3. State Machine Architecture Improvements

### Dynamic State Generation (src/alfred/core/workflow.py)
- **Current state**: Dynamic state names generated at runtime
- **Risk**: State names are used throughout the system for routing and persistence
- **Considerations**:
  - Any change to state naming convention breaks existing persisted states
  - Would require migration strategy for in-progress tasks
  - Consider adding state name validation/constants

## 4. Artifact Management Refactoring

### Context Store and Artifact Keys (multiple files)
- **Current state**: String-based keys for artifact storage with naming conventions
- **Risk**: Key mismatches can cause runtime errors
- **Suggested improvements**:
  - Create type-safe artifact key generation
  - Add validation for artifact storage/retrieval
  - Consider using enums for artifact types
- **Testing required**: Regression tests for all artifact operations

## 5. Transaction Logging Architecture

### Server-level logging (src/alfred/server.py)
- **Current state**: Decorator pattern applied for transaction logging
- **Risk**: Any changes affect audit trail and debugging capabilities
- **Future considerations**:
  - Add structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Consider async logging for performance
  - Add configurable log levels per tool

## 6. Task Provider Abstraction

### Provider Interface (src/alfred/task_providers/)
- **Current state**: Each provider implements similar patterns differently
- **Risk**: Changes affect integration with external systems (Jira, Linear)
- **Suggested improvements**:
  - Create formal interface/protocol for providers
  - Standardize error handling across providers
  - Add retry logic and circuit breakers
- **Testing required**: Mock-based tests for each provider

## 7. Prompt Template System

### Template Loading and Rendering (src/alfred/core/prompter.py)
- **Current state**: File-based templates with Jinja2
- **Risk**: Template changes can break AI interactions
- **Considerations**:
  - Add template validation on load
  - Version control for prompt templates
  - A/B testing framework for prompt improvements

## Recommendations

1. **Start with comprehensive test coverage** before attempting any high-risk refactoring
2. **Use feature flags** to gradually roll out architectural changes
3. **Create migration scripts** for any changes affecting persisted state
4. **Document all state machine flows** before modifying
5. **Consider backwards compatibility** for tools currently in use

## Priority Order

1. Add comprehensive test suite (prerequisite for all refactoring)
2. Extract common workflow tool pattern (medium risk, high value)
3. Decompose large functions (medium risk, improves maintainability)
4. Improve artifact management (high risk, prevents runtime errors)
5. Refactor state machine architecture (very high risk, defer until necessary)
